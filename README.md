### Deltas, David Wicks

David Wicks' Deltas simulation drew me in originally due the dreamy "mountain-like" figures that are peacefully spread across the screen.  Although randomized, they still look organized and cohesive together.  There is a sense of depth due to the layering of the spikes, even on a 2D screen.  I also appreciate the lack of color and use of fading in this piece, adding a more serious and elegant tone.  Deltas is a performance software that operates based on the movements of the user.  It is designed to function as an act of improvisation, where the spikes react to different motions by doing one of the following: "Multiply, turn, return, continue, separate, continue, turn, diverge."  I am intrigued by the set of commands given to the spikes and am very impressed by the coding behind this simulation.  Many of David Wicks piece fascinate me as they appear random but are based off of real-life, whether it be motion in this piece or rainfall, voices, photography lenses in some of his other examples.

### Chance and Order V, Kenneth Martin

Chance and Order is a series of colored lines that are ordered based on a series of commands.  I grew up living in a modern house and have always had an appreciation for simplistic, clean artwork.  This caught my attention as something that would have blended in hanging up in my own house, and now I understand that the lines are not random but based on an algorithm.  “The points of intersection on a grid of squares are numbered and the numbers are written on small cards and picked at random...A line is made between each successive pair of numbers as they are picked out”.  Chance and Order V was published in 1972, before New Media Art was generated through computer code.  However, the idea that the pattern of the art depends on certain rules implies in the same manner.  If this were to be recreated today, the code could randomly generate numbers instead of a human picking a card.  It is interesting to me that the same concept can exist over time and be just as impactful whether a piece is produced through intense code or basic rules.  Kenneth Martin made a series of Chance and Order pieces, each time different because different cards would be drawn.  I enjoyed learning about this process and appreciate the beauty behind the lack of precise line placement.
